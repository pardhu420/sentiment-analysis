# sentiment-analysis
This study compares classical and deep learning models for sentiment analysis on IMDb reviews. It evaluates Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LSTM, RNN, and Bayesian Networks. Preprocessing techniques used include Bag of Words (BoW), tokenization, and padding. Deep models like LSTM and RNN performed best, capturing sequential patterns with high accuracy and F1 scores. Classical models achieved competitive results with lower computational cost. XGBoost was robust due to gradient boosting. Bayesian Networks offered a probabilistic approach for inference. Accuracy scores were: Logistic Regression (90.21%), XGBoost (86.13%), LSTM (85.25%), Naive Bayes (83%), and Bayesian Networks (80%). The results support combining classical, deep, and probabilistic models for efficient sentiment analysis systems.
